Koji Nakajima, Chief Producer at Bandai Namco Entertainment Inc. said: "ONE PIECE WORLD SEEKER is the                                 most ambitious ONE PIECE game ever. We’re aware of the huge potential for the game and wanted to ensure we matched                                      fans’ expectations. As such, we took the difficult decision to move the release date and use additional                                                 development time to create the best game possible.”

                            <h2>Persona 5 Royal scores top marks</h2>
                           <p>Persona 5 recently celebrated it's 2nd Anniversary during the week. Possibly one of the greatest JRPG's to be released, Persona 5 was released in Japan on September 15th 2016, and worldwide on April 4th 2017. Currently, I've clocked 143 hours (or therabouts) on the game and I'm well into my second playthrough. This game just oozes class, style and elegance, with arguably some of the best supporting cast a JRPG has to offer, with a soundtrack so perfect, it's should honestly be a crime as to how not many gamers know of Shoji Meguro. This game is immense, seriously. It's frustrating as well, but the good kind of frustrating. For example, I spent a good hour traversing through a dungeon using pure brute force (Physical attacks) because I wanted to conserve SP (Skill points), actually forgetting that certain enemies DEFLECT said physical attacks. So imagine, I've just used my strongest physical attack, which 1 hit KO's about 90% of enemies up to this point in the game on an enemy, only for the damage to rebound back to me and knock me out. Did I forget to mention I didn't save game for 1 hour? I just hope Atlus are reading this and lift their stream embargo on this glorious game. </p>
